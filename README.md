# TkinterApp
An age calculator app 

## Intructions:

* Install Python 3 and Pillow
* Clone the repo
* Open a terminal cd into the folder 'TkinterApp' and type 

And the images dont appear :\ You can change the image address in Image.open() to put your images

```bash
python3 age_cal.py
```
Enjoy :)
